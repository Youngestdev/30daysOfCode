# 30daysOfCode

On my journey back to HTML and CSS!.

Well, I suck at CSS and so I'll be building projects using those technologies as a student of [Next](https://next.tech)!

I'll publish articles periodically on my [blog](https://abdul.codes/blog)

# Preview Projects

That's a TODO. I'll add a live view of all projects here soon.
